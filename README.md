# School_District_Analysis

## Purpose

The purpose of this excercise was to get familiar with the Juptyter notebook web based application, the pandas library, and further our experience with Python with data manipulation. In this particular excercise, we cleaned, summarized and formatted school district data in Jupyter Notebooks to compare and present various factors of the data against eachother.

## Results

* How is the district summary affected?

The omission of 9th grade Thomas High School scores had a minimal effect on the District Summary. The difference in % for every category stayed within 1% of change. This includes the averages for math and reading scores, as well as passing percentages. Directly below are the before and after images for reference.
